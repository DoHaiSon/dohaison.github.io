I obtained my B.Sc. and Master degrees in Electronics and Telecommunications Technology from University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam in 2020 and 2023, respectively. Now, I'm a researcher at [ITI](https://iti.vnu.edu.vn/), Vietnam National University, Hanoi. My research interests include cyber security, blockchain technology, wireless communications, system identification, IoT system in Industry 4.0, and recently multi-object tracking.
